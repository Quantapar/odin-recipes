<h2>Samosa is a crispy, deep-fried pastry filled with spiced potatoes, peas offering a savory and flavorful snack.</h2>
<p>A samosa is a popular and delicious deep-fried pastry that is golden and crispy on the outside, 
    with a savory filling inside. Traditionally, the filling consists of spiced mashed potatoes, 
    peas, and a blend of aromatic spices like cumin, coriander, and garam masala, 
    but variations can include meat, lentils, or even paneer. 
    The pastry is shaped into a triangular or cone-like form and fried until perfectly crisp, 
    giving it a satisfying crunch with every bite. Samosas are often enjoyed as a snack or appetizer, 
    paired with tangy tamarind chutney or mint chutney, offering a delightful contrast of flavors and textures.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li> 
    <li> 4 tablespoons oil or ghee</li> 
    <li> 1/2 teaspoon salt</li> 
    <li>Water (as needed to knead the dough)</li> 
     <li>3-4 medium potatoes (boiled and mashed)</li> 
     <li>1/2 cup green peas (boiled)</li> 
     <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</li> 
     <li> Fresh cilantro (chopped)</li> 
    <li> Salt to taste</li> 
   <li> Oil (enough for deep frying)</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <p>To make samosas, begin by preparing the dough by mixing all-purpose flour,
         salt, and oil or ghee until the mixture becomes crumbly.
          Gradually add water and knead it into a firm, smooth dough. 
          Cover and let it rest for 30 minutes. For the filling, heat oil in a pan and add cumin seeds. 
          Once they splutter, add ginger-garlic paste, green chilies, and spices like turmeric, coriander,
           and garam masala. Stir for a minute, then add boiled, mashed potatoes, peas, and salt. 
           Mix well and cook for a few minutes until everything combines. Remove from heat and let the mixture cool. 

        Next, divide the dough into small balls and roll each one into a thin oval shape. 
        Cut the oval in half, fold each half into a cone, and seal the edges with water. 
        Fill the cone with the potato mixture, then seal the open edge tightly. 
        Once all samosas are filled, heat oil in a deep pan and fry the samosas on medium heat until golden brown and crispy.
         Drain on paper towels and serve hot with chutney.</p>
