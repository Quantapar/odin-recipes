    <h2>Aromatic Chicken Biryani: A Feast of Flavors</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a delightful blend of tender chicken, fragrant basmati rice, 
and aromatic spices that create an explosion of flavor in every bite. 
To prepare this dish, marinate chicken pieces in yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices like turmeric, 
chili powder, and garam masala for at least an hour to infuse rich flavors.
Meanwhile, parboil basmati rice with whole spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves, which enhance the aroma.
In a large pot, sauté onions until golden, then add marinated chicken and cook until tender. 
Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken, drizzle with saffron-infused milk, ghee, and a sprinkle of fried onions.
Seal the pot and let it simmer on low heat (dum) for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve this mouthwatering biryani with raita or a side salad for a perfect, flavorful meal.</p>

<b>Directions</b>
<p>To make delicious chicken biryani, start by marinating the chicken with yogurt,
         ginger-garlic paste, turmeric, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. 
         Let it marinate for at least an hour to absorb the flavors. 
         Meanwhile, soak basmati rice for 30 minutes, then parboil it with whole spices like cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves. 
         In a large pot, fry sliced onions in ghee or oil until golden and crisp, setting some aside for garnish. 
         Add the marinated chicken to the pot and cook until it’s tender and flavorful.
          Next, layer the parboiled rice over the chicken, drizzle saffron-infused milk on top,
           and sprinkle with fried onions. Seal the pot tightly and cook on low heat (dum) for 20-30 minutes,
            allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook. Once done, garnish with fresh cilantro and mint,
         and serve this aromatic biryani with raita or a salad.</p>
