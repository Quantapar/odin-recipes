    <h2>Aromatic Chicken Biryani: A Feast of Flavors</h2>
    <p>Chicken Biryani is a delightful blend of tender chicken, fragrant basmati rice, 
and aromatic spices that create an explosion of flavor in every bite. 
To prepare this dish, marinate chicken pieces in yogurt, ginger, garlic, and spices like turmeric, 
chili powder, and garam masala for at least an hour to infuse rich flavors.
Meanwhile, parboil basmati rice with whole spices such as cardamom, cinnamon, and bay leaves, which enhance the aroma.
In a large pot, saut√© onions until golden, then add marinated chicken and cook until tender. 
Layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken, drizzle with saffron-infused milk, ghee, and a sprinkle of fried onions.
Seal the pot and let it simmer on low heat (dum) for 20-30 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld together.
Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve this mouthwatering biryani with raita or a side salad for a perfect, flavorful meal.</p>
